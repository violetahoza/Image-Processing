# 🖼️ Image Processing – OpenCV Projects

This repository includes my work from the *Image Processing* course, where I used **C++** and **OpenCV** to implement a variety of basic and advanced image processing techniques.

The goal was to get hands-on experience with how computers interpret and manipulate images - from noise reduction to feature detection.
